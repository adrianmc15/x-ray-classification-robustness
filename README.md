# Modelling Robustness towards Noise in Tuberculosis detection through Chest X-Rays

The purpose of this project is to try to improve the robustness of a CNN to noise in x-ray image data, specifically when it comes to the noise associated with low doses in x-ray.

This project has the following structure fitting with different stages of the project. The order and summary of these stages is listed below:
1. **baseline_no_noise.ipynb**
    
    This file is the starter baseline, and consists of a CNN model adapted from https://www.kaggle.com/code/pisitjanthawee13/tuberculosis-detection-cnns-with-lime as a baseline for the project.

2. **test_set_noise_only.ipynb**

    This file is used to test the generalization of the previous model (trained on no-noise data) to a noisy dataset.

        Result was 51% Accuracy on Test Set

3. **train_test_model_noise.ipynb**

    This file both trains and tests the model on noisy data.

        Result was 90% Accuracy on Test Set
    
    Notes: Maybe try doing a mixture of noisy and non-noisy training data? See how that fairs

4. **apply_denoising.ipynb**

    This file includes denoising techniques in the preprocessing for the model

5. **loss_function_adjustment.ipynb**

    This notebook explores the adjustment of the loss function to better generalise and train the model to work with noise to noise architecture.

    - use mae and huber loss
    - attention mechanism

6. **Other Techniques**

    This will include a variety of other techniques for improving the network:
    - lung segmentation: https://github.com/IlliaOvcharenko/lung-segmentation (can be fed back into CNN)
    - ÃŸ
